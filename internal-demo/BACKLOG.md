# User Management and Authentication Enhancement Backlog

## Backend Enhancements

1. **Add Protected Endpoints**: Implement user-specific endpoints that can only be accessed by the authenticated user.
2. **Role-Based Authorization**: Develop a system to assign roles to users and restrict access to certain functionalities based on these roles.
3. **Full OAuth2 Implementation**: Set up a complete OAuth2 authentication flow with an authentication server, redirects, refresh tokens, etc.
4. **Password Reset Functionality**: Implement functionality for users to reset their passwords, typically involving sending a secure, time-limited reset link via email.
5. **Account Lockout Mechanism**: Implement a lockout mechanism that locks an account after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
6. **Audit Logging**: Create logs for critical actions like login, logout, and password changes for security auditing.
7. **Rate Limiting on Sensitive Endpoints**: Protect endpoints such as login and registration from abuse by implementing rate limiting.
8. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Add an additional layer of security by implementing 2FA.
9. **Email Verification on Account Creation**: Send a verification email upon new user registration to confirm ownership of the email address.
10. **User Profile Management**: Allow users to manage their profile information (viewing and editing).
11. **Session Management**: Manage user sessions server-side, allowing functionalities like viewing all active sessions and ending specific sessions.
12. **LDAP/Active Directory Integration**: Implement integration with LDAP or Active Directory for user authentication and management, allowing users to log in using their existing credentials.

## Frontend Enhancements

13. **JWT Management and Storage**: Implement logic to manage JWT storage and keep the user logged in across page reloads if the saved JWT is valid.
14. **Token Auto-Renewal**: Add functionality to automatically renew JWT tokens before they expire.
15. **Improved Login UI**: Enhance the user interface for login to handle different states (loading, success, error) more effectively.
16. **Forgot Password UI Flow**: Implement a user interface flow for password reset functionality.
17. **Account Activation UI Flow**: Create a user interface flow for email verification-based account activation.
18. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that authentication pages are responsive across different devices.

## Security Enhancements

19. **Implement HTTPS**: Ensure that all communications are secured using HTTPS.
20. **CORS Policy Review**: Review and adjust the CORS policy to ensure that only trusted domains can interact with the API.
21. **Security Headers**: Add security headers in API responses to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
22. **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Ensure robust validation and sanitization of user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## System and Infrastructure

23. **Containerization and Orchestration**: Containerize services and use an orchestrator like Kubernetes for scalability and management.
24. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Establish CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
25. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up monitoring for services with alerting for operational issues or anomalies.
26. **Load Testing**: Conduct load testing to ensure the system can handle high numbers of simultaneous users.
